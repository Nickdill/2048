2048
====

*tl;dr* Run:

    java game2048.Main

Read instuctions.txt for a VERY in-depth instruction on how this program works.
Otherwise, this was a programming assignment given to me in my Data Structures class. 
Using a graphical API provided and a basic skeleton with a suggested route to creating this program,
I created the main.java which merged the given methods from the API with the various data inputs created during gameplay.
This took a little over 15 hours, including the time spent trying to understand the prompt and reading through the given API/skeleton code.

Enjoy!
